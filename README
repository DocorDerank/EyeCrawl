EyeCrawl - x86 disassembler

This is a project I started just a few days ago...
Didn't even realize it'd work as good as it is today.

The goal of this project was not only to convert bytes to instructions,
but to get the offsets of registers, for use in analyzing structs/etc.

It also allows you to analyze different segments of the instruction
such as 8/16/32bit values in the first or second operand of it.

Or, if you wanted to capture every instruction starting with an esi register
or an offset of esi in a function.

So if this was ever a struggle to you, say no more.
Although this is still WIP and limited (It does not have all instructions yet)
this is a functional disassembler I created that you can include in your code.
